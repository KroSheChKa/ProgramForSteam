# ProgramForSteam
So, I would like to introduce to you my first ever public project. It should be a program, that hacks steam achievements. The logic question is what is the difference between your program and the SAM Picker. I would like to make the process of hacking fastier and also the program should have the same concept as Steam Idler and some more functional that will make life with steam easier. Also, I want to make the design really easy-to-rotate. I'll think about upgrading this program to theâ€‚excellent state.
